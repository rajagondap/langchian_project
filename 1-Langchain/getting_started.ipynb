Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

State of the art\\npassive microwave circulators are based on magneto-optic\\neﬀects which require sizable magnetic ﬁelds incompati-\\nble with ultra-low loss superconducting circuits forming\\na major roadblock towards a fully integrated quantum\\nprocessor based on superconducting qubits.\\nMany recent theoretical and experimental eﬀorts have\\nbeen devoted to overcome these limitations both in the\\noptical [12–14] and microwave regimes [2–5, 15–18]. In\\nparallel, the rapidly growing ﬁeld of optomechanical and\\nelectromechanical systems has shown promising potential\\nfor applications in quantum information processing and\\ncommunication, in particular for microwave to optical\\n∗shabir.barzanjeh@ist.ac.at\\n† jﬁnk@ist.ac.at\\nconversion [19, 20] and ampliﬁcation [21]. Very recently,\\nseveral theoretical proposals [6, 22, 23] have pointed out\\nthat optomechanical systems can lead to nonreciprocity\\nand ﬁrst isolators have just been demonstrated in the\\noptical domain [24–26]. Here, we present an on-chip mi-\\ncrowave circulator using a new and tunable silicon elec-\\ntromechanical system.\\nThe main elements of the microchip circulator device\\nare shown in Fig. 1 a-b.\\nThe circuit is comprised of\\nthree high-impedance spiral inductors (Li) capacitively\\ncoupled to the in-plane vibrational modes of a dielectric\\nnanostring mechanical resonator. The nanostring oscilla-\\ntor consists of two thin silicon beams that are connected\\nby two symmetric tethers and fabricated from a high re-\\nsistivity silicon-on-insulator device layer [27]. Four alu-\\nminum electrodes are aligned and evaporated on top of\\nthe two nanostrings, forming one half of the vacuum gap\\ncapacitors that are coupled to three microwave resonators\\nand one DC voltage bias line as shown schematically in\\nFig. 1c (see App. A for details).\\nThe voltage bias line can be used to generate an attrac-\\ntive force which pulls the nanobeam and tunes the oper-\\nating point frequencies of the device [9]. Fig. 1 d shows\\nthe measured resonance frequency change as a function\\nof the applied bias voltage Vdc. As expected, resonators\\n1 and 3 are tuned to higher frequency due to an increased\\nvacuum gap while resonator 2 is tuned to lower frequency.\\nA large tunable bandwidth of up to 30 MHz as obtained\\nfor resonator 2, the ability to excite the motion directly\\nand to modulate the electromechanical coupling in-situ\\nrepresents an important step towards new optomechani-\\ncal experiments and more practicable on-chip reciprocal\\nand nonreciprocal devices.\\nAs a ﬁrst step we carefully calibrate and character-\\nize the individual electromechanical couplings and noise\\nproperties. We then measure the bidirectional frequency\\nconversion between two microwave resonator modes as\\nmediated by one mechanical mode [10]. The incoming\\nsignal photons can also be distributed to two ports with\\nvarying probability as a function of the parametric drive\\nstrength and in direct analogy to a tunable beam split-\\nter.\\nWe present the experimental results, the relevant\\nsample parameters and the theoretical analysis of this\\nbidirectional frequency conversion process in App. B.\\nDirectionality is achieved by engaging the second me-\\nchanical mode, a method which was developed in paral-\\nlel to this work [28, 29] for demonstrating nonreciproc-\\narXiv:1706.00376v2  [quant-ph]  6 Jun 2017\\n2\\nResonator 1\\nNanostring\\nPort 1\\nPort 2\\nVdc (V)\\n- 4\\n- 2\\n0\\n 2\\n4\\n11.38\\n11.37\\n9.58\\n9.59\\n9.60\\n9.77\\n9.78\\n9.79\\n9.80\\nFrequency (GHz)\\nCs,1\\nCm,1\\nCm,3\\nCm,2\\nCm\\nL1\\nCs,3\\nL3\\nCs,2\\nL2\\na1,in\\na2,out\\nport 1\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nport 2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\nVdc\\nmode 2\\nmode 1\\na\\nd\\nc\\nb\\nVdc\\n10 ¹m\\n100 ¹m\\nResonator 3\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 1\\nResonator 2\\nResonator 3\\nFIG. 1.\\nMicrochip circulator and tunability. a, Scan-\\nning electron micrograph of the electromechanical device in-\\ncluding three microwave resonators, two physical ports, one\\nvoltage bias input (Vdc) and an inset of the spiral inductor\\ncross-overs (green dashed boxed area). b, Enlarged view of\\nthe silicon nanostring mechanical oscillator with four vacuum-\\ngap capacitors coupled to the three inductors and one voltage\\nbias.

We begin\\nwith the theoretical model describing two microwave cav-\\nities with resonance frequencies ωi and total linewidths\\nκi with i = 1, 2 parametrically coupled to two distinct\\nmodes of a mechanical resonator with resonance frequen-\\ncies ωm,j and damping rates γm,j with j = 1, 2. To es-\\ntablish the parametric coupling, we apply four microwave\\ntones, with frequencies detuned by δj from the lower mo-\\ntional sidebands of the resonances, as shown in Fig. 2a.\\nIn a reference frame rotating at the frequencies ωi and\\nωm,j +δj, the linearized Hamiltonian in the resolved side-\\nband regime (ωm,j ≫κ1, κ2) is given by (¯h = 1)\\nH = −\\nX\\nj=1,2\\nδjb†\\njbj +\\nX\\ni,j=1,2\\nGij\\n\\x10\\neiφijaib†\\nj + e−iφija†\\nibj\\n\\x11\\n+Hoﬀ,\\n(1)\\nwhere ai (bj) is the annihilation operator for the cavity\\ni (mechanics j), Gij = g0,ij√nij and g0ij are the ef-\\nfective and vacuum electromechanical coupling rates be-\\ntween the mechanical mode j and cavity i respectively,\\nwhile nij is the total number of photons inside the cavity\\ni due to the drive with detuning ∆ij, and φij is the rel-\\native phase set by drives. Here, ∆11 = ∆21 = ωm,1 + δ1\\nand ∆22 = ∆12 = ωm,2 + δ2 are the detunings of the\\ndrive tones with respect to the cavities and Hoﬀde-\\nscribes the time dependent coupling of the mechanical\\nmodes to the cavity ﬁelds due to the oﬀ-resonant drive\\ntones.\\nThese additional coupling terms create cross-\\ndamping [30] and renormalize the mechanical modes, and\\ncan only be neglected in the weak coupling regime for\\nGij, κj ≪ωj, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\nTo see how the nonreciprocity arises we use the quan-\\ntum Langevin equations of motion along with the input-\\noutput theorem to express the scattering matrix Sij of\\nthe system described by the Hamiltonian (1), and relat-\\ning the input photons ain,i(ωi) at port i to the output\\nphotons aout,j(ωj) at port j via aout,i = P\\nj=1,2 Sijain,i\\nwith i = 1, 2.\\nThe dynamics of the four-mode sys-\\ntem described by Hamiltonian (1) is fully captured by\\na set of linear equations of motion as veriﬁed in App. C.\\nSolving these equations in the frequency domain, us-\\ning the input-output relations, and setting φ22 = φ,\\nφ11 = φ21 = φ12 = 0, the ratio of backward to forward\\ntransmission reads\\nλ := S12(ω)\\nS21(ω) =\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)eiφ\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)e−iφ .\\n(2)\\nHere, Σm,j = 1 + 2i\\n\\x02\\n(−1)jδ −ω\\n\\x03\\n/γm,j is the inverse of\\nthe mechanical susceptibility divided by the mechanical\\nlinewidth γm,j and Cij = 4G2\\nij/(κiγm,j) is the optome-\\nchanical cooperativity.

(2) we assume\\nthe device satisﬁes the impedance matching condition on\\nresonance i.e. Sii(ω = 0) = 0 which can be achieved in\\nthe high cooperativity limit (Cij ≫1).\\nInspection of equation (2) reveals the crucial role of\\nthe relative phase between the drive tones φ and the de-\\ntuning δ to obtain nonreciprocal transmission. When the\\ncooperativities for all four optomechanical couplings are\\nequal (Cij = C) then perfect isolation, i.e. λ = 0, occurs\\nfor\\ntan[φ(ω)] = δ(γm,1 + γm,2) + ω(γm,2 −γm,1)\\nγm,1γm,2/2 −2(δ2 −ω2)\\n.\\n(3)\\nEquation 3 shows that on resonance (ω = 0) tan[φ] ∝δ,\\nhighlighting the importance of the detuning δ to obtain\\nnonreciprocity.

Optomechanical isolator. a, Mode coupling dia-\\ngram for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity. Two mi-\\ncrowave cavities (C1 and C2) are coupled to two mechanical\\nmodes (M1 and M2) with the optomechanical coupling rates\\nGij (where i, j = 1, 2), inducing two distinct signal conversion\\npaths. Power spectral density (PSD) of the two microwave\\ncavities and arrows indicating the frequency of the four mi-\\ncrowave pump tones slightly detuned by δi from the lower\\nmotional sidebands of the resonances.\\nAll four pumps are\\nphase-locked while the signal tone is applied.\\nOnly one of\\nthe microwave source phases is varied to ﬁnd the optimal in-\\nterference condition for directional transmission between port\\n1 and 2. b, Measured power transmission (dots) in forward\\n|S21|2 (cavity 1 →cavity 2) and backward directions |S12|2\\n(cavity 2 →cavity 1) as a function of probe detuning for two\\ndiﬀerent phases φ = ±102.6 degrees. The solid lines show the\\nresults of the coupled-mode theory model discussed in the\\ntext. c, Experimental data (top) and theoretical model (bot-\\ntom) of measured transmission coeﬃcients |S12|2 and |S21|2 as\\na function of signal detuning and pump phase φ. Dashed-lines\\nindicate the line plot locations of panel b.\\nwhere η1(2) = κext,1(2)/κ1(2) is the resonator coupling ra-\\ntio and κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate.\\nHere κint,i denotes the internal loss rate and κext,i the\\nloss rate due to the cavity to waveguide coupling. Equa-\\ntion (4) shows that the maximum of the transmission in\\nforward direction, |S21|2 = η1η2[1−(2C)−1], occurs when\\n2C = 1 + 4δ2/γ2 and for large cooperativities C ≫1.\\nThese conditions, as implemented in our experiment, en-\\nable the observation of asymmetric frequency conversion\\nwith strong isolation in the backward direction and small\\ninsertion loss in forward direction.\\nUsing the on-chip electromechanical microwave circuit\\nshown in Fig. 1 a, we experimentally realize directional\\nwavelength conversion between two superconducting coil\\nresonators at (ω1, ω2)/2π = (9.55, 9.82) GHz coupled to\\ntwo diﬀerent physical waveguide ports and measurement\\nlines with (η1, η2) = (0.74, 0.86). Here, we use the two\\nlowest-frequency vibrational in-plane modes of the me-\\nchanical resonator at (ωm,1, ωm,2)/2π = (4.34, 5.64) MHz\\nwith intrinsic damping rates (γm,1, γm,2)/2π = (4, 8) Hz.\\nThe vacuum optomechanical coupling strengths for these\\nmode combinations are (g0,11, g0,12, g0,21, g0,22)/2π\\n=\\n(33, 34, 13, 31) Hz.\\nFigure 2 b shows the measured transmission of the\\nwavelength conversion in the forward |S21|2 and back-\\nward directions |S12|2 as a function of probe detuning\\nfor two diﬀerent phases as set by one out of the four\\nphase locked microwave drives. At φ = −102.6 degree\\nand over a frequency range of 1.5 kHz we measure high\\ntransmission from cavity 1 to 2 with an insertion loss of\\n2.4 dB while in the backward direction the transmission\\nis suppressed by up to 40.4 dB. Likewise, at the positive\\nphase of φ = 102.6 degree the transmission from cavity 1\\nto 2 is suppressed while the transmission from cavity 2 to\\n1 is high. In both cases we observe excellent agreement\\nwith theory (solid lines). Fig. 2 c shows the S parameters\\nfor the whole range of phases φ, which are symmetric and\\nbidirectional around φ = 0. We ﬁnd excellent agreement\\nwith theory over the full range of measured phases with\\nless than 10% deviation to independently calibrated drive\\nphoton numbers and without any other free parameters.\\nFor bidirectional wavelength conversion, higher coop-\\nerativity enhances the bandwidth. In contrast, the band-\\nwidth of the nonreciprocal conversion is independent of\\ncooperativity and set only by the intrinsic mechanical\\nlinewidths γm,i, which can be seen in Eq (2). This high-\\nlights the fact that the isolation appears when the en-\\ntire signal energy is dissipated in the mechanical environ-\\nment, a lossy bath that can be engineered eﬀectively [7].\\nIn the present case it is the oﬀ-resonant coupling be-\\ntween the resonators and the mechanical oscillator which\\nmodiﬁes this bath. The applied drives create an eﬀec-\\ntive interaction between the mechanical modes, where\\none mode acts as a reservoir for the other and vice versa.\\nThis changes both the damping rates and the eigenfre-\\nquencies of the mechanical modes. It therefore increases\\nthe instantaneous bandwidth of the conversion and auto-\\nmatically introduces the needed detuning, which is fully\\ntaken into account in the theory.\\nThe described two-port isolator can be extended to an\\neﬀective three-port device by parametrically coupling the\\nthird microwave resonator capacitively to the dielectric\\nnanostring, as shown in Fig. 1 a. The third resonator at\\na resonance frequency of ω3/2π = 11.30 GHz is coupled\\nto the waveguide with η3 = 0.52 and to the two in-plane\\nmechanical modes with (g0,31, g0,32)/2π = (22, 45) Hz.\\nSimilar to the isolator, we establish a parametric cou-\\n4\\n1.9 dB cavity loss\\n3.4 dB cavity loss\\n4.1 dB cavity loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n3.8 dB insertion loss\\n4.4 dB insertion loss\\n3\\n3\\na\\nb\\nc\\nTransmission (dB)\\n-40\\n-30\\n-20\\n-10\\n0\\nPump phase (deg)\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\n-180\\n-90\\n0\\n90\\n180\\nProbe detuning (Hz)\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\n-700 -350\\n350 700\\n0\\nData\\nData\\nData\\nTheory\\nTheory\\nTheory\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS31j2\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nPhase = -54\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\nC3\\nC2\\nC1\\njS12j2\\njS23j2\\njS32j2\\njS13j2\\njS31j2\\njS21j2\\nC1\\nM2\\nM1\\nC2\\nG11\\nG21\\nG22\\nG12\\nG31\\nG32\\na1,in\\na1,out\\na3,in\\na3,out\\nC2\\na2,in\\na2,out\\n0\\n-20\\n-40\\ndB\\nFIG. 3.

Using\\nan extra microwave source as probe signal, we measure\\nthe power transmission between all ports and directions\\nas shown in Fig. 3 b for a single ﬁxed phase of φ = −54\\ndegree, optimized experimentally for forward circulation.\\nAt this phase we see high transmission in the for-\\nward direction S21,32,13 with an insertion loss of (3.8,\\n3.8, 4.4) dB and an isolation in the backward direction\\nS12,23,31 of up to (18.5, 23, 23) dB.

The nanostring resonator fabricated\\nfrom a high resistivity smart-cut silicon-on-insulator wafer with 220 nm device layer thickness has a length of 9.4 µm\\nand consists of two metalized beams that are connected with two tethers at their ends. The vacuum gap size for the\\nmechanically compliant capacitor fabricated with an inverse shadow technique [31] is approximately 60 nm.\\nThe electromechanical coupling between the nanostring mechanical resonator and each LC circuit is given by\\ng0i = xzpf\\n∂ωi\\n∂v = −xzpfζi\\nωi\\n2Cm,i\\n∂Cm,i\\n∂v\\n,\\n(A1)\\nwhere v is the amplitude coordinate of the in-plane mode, ζi = Cm,i\\nCΣ,i is the participation ratio of the vacuum gap\\ncapacitance Cm,i to the total capacitance of the circuit CΣ,i = Cm,i + Cs,i, where Cs,i is the stray capacitance of the\\ncircuit including the intrinsic self-capacitance of the inductor coils. Eq. (A1) indicates that large electromechanical\\ncoupling g0i requires a large participation ratio. We can make the coil capacitance CL,i relatively small by using a\\nsuspended and tightly wound rectangular spiral inductor with a wire width of 500 nm and wire-to-wire pitch of 1µm\\n[32].

As predicted by Eq. (B2),\\nthe transmission between the two cavities is maximum for C1 = C2 ≈95.

In fact this term allows both optomechanical cooling (with rate Γi = 4G2\\ni /κi) and\\nbidirectional photon conversion between two distinct microwave frequencies. In the photon conversion process, ﬁrst\\nan input microwave signal at frequency ω1 with amplitude ain,1(ω1) is down-converted into the mechanical mode at\\nfrequency ωm, i.e. a1(ω1)\\nH∝a1b†\\n−−−−−→b(ωm).

In fact, the Hermitian aspect of the Hamiltonian (B1) makes the conversion process bidirectional and holds\\nthe time-reversal symmetry.\\nThe photon conversion eﬃciency, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the output-signal photon ﬂux over the input-signal\\nphoton ﬂux, is given by |S21|2 =\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\naout,2(ω2)\\nain,1(ω1)\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n2\\n. Since the conversion process is bidirectional therefore |S21| = |S12| = |T|.\\nIn the steady state and in the weak coupling regime the conversion eﬃciency reduces to\\n|T|2 =\\n4η1η2C1C2\\n(1 + C1 + C2)2 ,\\n(B2)\\n9\\nwhere C1(2) =\\n4g2\\n0,1(2)n1(2)\\nκ1(2)γm\\nis the electromechanical cooperativity for cavity 1 (2) and η1(2) =\\nκext,1(2)\\nκ1(2)\\nis the output\\ncoupling ratio in which κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and\\nextrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively.

The former condition balances the photon-phonon conversion rate for each cavity\\nwhile the later condition guarantees the mechanical damping rate γm is much weaker than the damping rates Γi =\\nγmCi. Under these two conditions, the ideal photon conversion is achieved i.e. |T|2 = 1 (perfect transmission) and\\n|S11|2 = |S22|2 = 0 (no reﬂection). The denominator of Eq. (B2) indicates that the bandwidth of the conversion is\\ngiven by ΓT = γm + Γ1 + Γ2, which is the total back-action-damped linewidth of the mechanical resonator in the\\npresence of the two microwave drive ﬁelds.\\nWe perform coherent microwave frequency conversion using the intermediate nanostring resonator as a coupling\\nelement between two superconducting coil resonators at ω1/2π = 9.55 GHz and ω2/2π = 9.82 GHz as shown in\\nFig 1 a. The microwave cavities are accessible by ports”, i.e. semi-inﬁnite transmission lines giving the modes ﬁnite\\nenergy decay rates leading to the cavity linewidths κ1/2π = 2.42 MHz and κ2/2π = 1.98 MHz with associated\\noutput coupling ratios η1 = 0.74 and η2 = 0.86, indicating that both cavities are strongly overcoupled to the two\\ndistinct physical ports 1 and 2. The fundamental mode of the mechanical oscillator has a resonance frequency of\\nωm/2π = 4.34MHz with the corresponding damping rate of γm/2π = 4Hz. Measuring the mechanical resonator noise\\nspectrum along with the oﬀ-resonant reﬂection coeﬃcients of each cavity and measurement line, we calibrate the gain\\nand attenuation in each input-output line and accurately back out the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate for each\\ncavity of g01/2π = 33Hz and g02/2π = 13Hz.\\nFigure 4 c shows the measured scattering parameters |S11|2 (red line), |S22|2 (blue line), and |T|2 = |S12| · |S21|\\n(yellow line) versus the electromechanical cooperativity C2 at C1 = 95. As predicted by Eq. (B2) at C1 = C2 ≃95\\nwe measure a transmission of |T|2 = 0.64, which is dominated by internal losses of the cavities limiting the maximum\\nreachable conversion eﬃciency to |T|2 ≤η1η2 = 0.64.\\nAnother important aspect of such a transducer is the dynamic range of the device. In the inset of Fig. 4 c we\\nshow measured maximum transmission as a function of the applied signal power. Our results demonstrate that high\\nconversion eﬃciencies can be maintained up to about −80 dBm input signal power, corresponding to about 105 signal\\nphotons inside the cavities. At even higher signal powers the transmission eﬃciency is degraded abruptly, because\\nthe probe tone acts as an additional strong drive invalidating the transducer model, and also because of an increase\\nof the resonance frequency shifts and resonator losses.\\nAppendix C: General theory of a coupled electromechanical system\\n1.\\nHamiltonian of a multi-mode electromechanical transducer\\nIn this section we present a general theory to describe the nonreciprocal behavior of our on-chip electromechanical\\ntransducer, shown in Fig 1a of the main paper. We begin with an optomechanical system comprised of three microwave\\ncavities with frequencies ωi and linewidths κi where i = 1, 2, 3 that are coupled to two vibrational modes of a\\nmechanical oscillator with frequencies ωm.i and damping rates γm,i where i = 1, 2. To tune a desired coupling into\\nresonance, we assume the cavities are coherently driven with six microwave tones, with frequencies detuned from the\\nlower motional sidebands of the resonances by δ0,i. The Hamiltonian of the system is (¯h = 1)[34]\\nH =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\nωia†\\niai +\\n2\\nX\\ni=1\\nωm,ib†\\nibi +\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\ng0,ija†\\niai(bj + b†\\nj) + Hd,\\n(C1)\\nwhere ai is the annihilation operator for the cavity i, bj is the annihilation operator of the mechanical mode j, and\\nHd =\\n3\\nX\\ni=1\\n2\\nX\\nj=1\\nEij(aiei(ωd,ijt+φij) + a†\\nie−i(ωd,ijt+φij)),\\n(C2)\\n10\\ndescribes the Hamiltonian of the pumps with amplitude Eij = E∗\\nij, frequency ωd,ij, and phase φij.\\nWe can linearize Hamiltonian (C1) by expanding the cavity modes around their steady-state ﬁeld amplitudes,\\nai →ai −P2\\nj=1 αije−iωd,ijt, where |αij|2 = 4|Eije−iφij|2/(κ2\\ni + 4∆2\\nij) is the mean number of photons inside the cavity\\ni induced by the microwave pump due to driving mechanical mode j, the κi = κint,i + κext,i is the total damping rate\\nof the cavity while κint,i and κext,i show the intrinsic and extrinsic decay rate of the microwave cavities, respectively.\\nHere, ∆ij = ωi −ωd,ij is the detuning of the drive tone with respect to cavity i.

Inspection of Hamiltonians (C4)\\nand (C5) reveals that each drive tone generates two diﬀerent types of interactions: Resonant coupling in which the\\ndrive tone couples a single mechanical mode to a single cavity mode, described by the time-independent part of the\\nHamiltonian (C4). Each drive tone also generates an interaction which couples the other mechanical mode to the\\ncavity oﬀ-resonantly. The Hamiltonians (C5) explain this oﬀ-resonant coupling between cavity ﬁelds and mechanical\\nmodes. As we will see, these oﬀ-resonant couplings alter the mechanical damping rate, which changes the isolation\\nbandwidth and also cools the mechanical modes. In addition, the coupling also introduces mechanical frequency shifts\\nand introduces an eﬀective detuning for the drive tones. Note that, within the rotating wave approximation (RWA)\\nthe non-resonant/time-dependent components of the eﬀective linearized interactions can be neglected in the weak\\ncoupling regime and when the cavity decay rates κi are much smaller than the two mechanical frequencies ωm,i and\\ntheir diﬀerence\\n|Fij|, κi ≪ωm,j, |ωm,2 −ωm,1|.\\n(C7)\\nFinally, we note that for the isolator case we deal with two cavities coupled two mechanical modes, which mathemat-\\nically is equivalent to set G31 = G32 = F31 = F32 = 0 in our general model.

The auxiliary modes A±\\ni = aie±iδωmt, B1 = b1eiδωmt and B2 = b2e−iδωmt describe the oﬀ-resonant\\ncomponents of the equations of motion. Here, we take δωm to be much larger than the relevant system frequencies, i.e.\\nδωm ≫γm,i, δ0,i, ω, and can thus adiabatically eliminate the auxiliary modes by taking ˙Bj = ˙A±\\ni = 0 in Eqs.

(C13) we assume that the oﬀ-resonant interaction does not considerably modify the\\nself-interaction and damping rate of the cavity modes. Inspection of Eqs. (C13) reveals that the oﬀ-resonant coupling\\nbetween mechanical modes and cavities shifts the resonance frequency and damps/cools the mechanical modes by\\nintroducing a cross-damping between them. The strength of the frequency shift and the cross-damping is given by\\nthe oﬀ-resonant optomechanical coupling parameters Fij, which indicates that the drive tones creates an eﬀective\\ncoupling between the two mechanical modes. In the weak coupling regime and for very large δωm this cross-coupling\\nis negligible, thus δj ≈δ0,j and Γm,j ≈γm,j.\\nWe can solve the Eqs.

(C16) and assuming φ22 = φ, φ11 = φ12 = φ21 = 0, we can ﬁnd the ratio\\nof backward to forward transmission\\nλ := S12(ω)\\nS21(ω) =\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)eiφ\\n√C11C21Σm,2(ω) + √C12C22Σm,1(ω)e−iφ ,\\n(C17)\\nas speciﬁed in Eq.

(C17) shows that the nominator and\\ndenominator of this equation are not equal and they possess diﬀerent relative phase. This asymmetry is the main\\nsource of the nonreciprocity and appearance of isolation in the system. In particular, at a phase\\neiφ = −\\nr\\nC11C21\\nC12C22\\nΣm,2(ω)\\nΣm,1(ω),\\n(C18)\\nthe nominator of the Eq. (C17) will be zero, therefore, backward transmission S12 is canceled while forward trans-\\nmission S21 is non-zero. Rewriting Eq.

(C19)\\nreduces to Eq. (3) of the paper. At the optimum phase (C18) and at cavity resonance, the transmission in the forward\\ndirection is given by\\nS21 = −\\n2√η1η2\\n\\x02\\nΣm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03\\x00√C11C21Σm,2(0) + √C12C22Σm,1(0)e−iφ\\x01\\n\\x02\\nC11Σm,2(0) + C12Σm,1(0) + Σm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03\\x02\\nC21Σm,2(0) + C22Σm,1(0) + Σm,1(0)Σm,2(0)\\n\\x03.\\nFor equal mechanical damping Γm,1 = Γm,2 = Γ (equivalent to γm,1 = γm,2 = γ of the main text) and at equal\\ncooperativities for all four optomechanical couplings (Cij = C) the above equation reduces to\\nS21 = −√η1η2\\nh\\n4i δ(1 −2iδ/Γ)\\nCΓ(1 + 1+4δ2/Γ2\\n2C\\n)2\\ni\\n(C20)\\nas speciﬁed in Eq.

We also note that the frequency shifts due to oﬀ-resonant interaction for the isolator system discussed\\nin the main text are given by (δ1, δ2)/2π = (−84, 233) Hz while the cross-damping rates are (Γm,1, Γm,2)/2π =\\n(190, 407) Hz.\\n4.\\nTheoretical model for the circulator\\nThe theoretical model, we presented in Eqs. (C11), or equivalently Eq. (C16), fully describes the nonreciprocal\\nbehavior of the system for the case of the circulator.\\nIn order to check this, in Fig. 5 we show both measured\\nexperimental data and the theoretical prediction.

The only remaining unknown parameter in Eq.

For instance, the influential textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig) describes:\\n\\nAgent: Anything that perceives its environment (using sensors) and acts upon it (using actuators). E.g., a robot with cameras and wheels, or a software program that reads data and makes recommendations.\\nRational Agent: An agent that strives to achieve the *best possible outcome* based on its knowledge and past experiences. \"Best\" is defined by a performance measure – a way of evaluating how well the agent is doing.\\nArtificial Intelligence (as a field): The study and creation of these rational agents.\\nOther researchers and definitions build upon this foundation. Padgham & Winikoff emphasize that intelligent agents should react to changes in their environment in a timely way, proactively pursue goals, and be flexible and robust (able to handle unexpected situations). Some also suggest that ideal agents should be \"rational\" in the economic sense (making optimal choices) and capable of complex reasoning, like having beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI model). Kaplan and Haenlein offer a similar definition, focusing on a system\\'s ability to understand external data, learn from that data, and use what is learned to achieve goals through flexible adaptation.\\nDefining AI in terms of intelligent agents offers several key advantages:\\n\\nAvoids Philosophical Debates: It sidesteps arguments about whether AI is \"truly\" intelligent or conscious, like those raised by the Turing test or Searle\\'s Chinese Room. It focuses on behavior and goal achievement, not on replicating human thought.\\nObjective Testing: It provides a clear, scientific way to evaluate AI systems. Researchers can compare differen')]"
