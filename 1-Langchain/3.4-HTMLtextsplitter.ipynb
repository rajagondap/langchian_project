    "# How to split ny HTML header\n",
    "Similar in concept to the MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter, the HTMLHeaderTextSplitter is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline."
